      Answers the question: "How does a particular metric change over time within the dataset?"

      This view tracks the evolution of COVID-19 metrics globally over time, specifically:
      1. Daily progression of total cases and deaths
      2. New cases reported each day
      3. 7-day moving average to smooth out reporting irregularities
      4. Growth rate to understand pandemic acceleration/deceleration

      The time series analysis helps identify:
      - Peak periods of the pandemic
      - Effectiveness of global containment measures
      - Reporting patterns and potential data anomalies
